The multi-regional partitioning process has been verified to include all buses without omission.

The best clustering configuration consists of 5 regions and 16 inter-regional tie-lines, identified within 10 iterations.
The reference bus 17 in the MATPOWER case has been assigned to Region 2 (mpc_regionR2).

The graph topology was verified to be fully connected.
The total number of branches across all regions, including inter-regional tie-lines, matches the number of branches in the MATPOWER case, which is 597.
The total number of buses across all regions matches the number of buses in the MATPOWER case, which is 500.
The total number of generators across all regions matches the number of generators in the MATPOWER case, which is 90.
